## Features
- Based on Symfony 5.2 providing all of its features
- Orkestra Components are bundled and tightly integrated with Symfony's dependency Injection
- CQRS Support
- Event Sourcing Support
- DDD Support
- PostgreSQL as Database
- Long Running Processes
- [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/) application server
- Pub/Sub capabilities through messaging and [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)
- Ideal for:
  - Web Apps
  - Microservices
  - Backend Systems
  - CLI Apps
- Modern: PHP 7.3+

```

## Console Commands
The framework is shipped with console commands to operate the Projections, the Event Processor and the Timer Processor:

### Debugging Messaging
Use the following to see the class map of messages
```shell
bin/console orkestra:messaging:debug-classmap
```

To see which messages are routed to which handlers:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:messaging:debug-router
```

### Event Processor
To show the progress of the event processor:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:event-processor progress
```

To continuously run the processor:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:event-processor start
````

To replay the events
```shell
bin/console orkestra:event-processor replay
````
> Be advised that this command should not be used in production, and can have unexpected side effects.

To reset the processor to the start of the stream:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:event-processor reset
````
> Be advised that this command should not be used in production, and can have unexpected side effects.


### Timer Processor
To start the timer processor
```shell
bin/console orkestra:timer-processor
```

### Projection Processor
To show the progress of the projection processor:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:projection-processor progress
```

To continuously run the processor:
```shell
bin/console orkestra:projection-processor start
````

To replay the projections
